# LWB-Learn-While-Browsing
A Chrome extension which helps users learn new languages as they are surfing the web. 

This extension allows users to do whatever they wish on the web, while learning some new words in a language
of their desire. This extension is very self-explanatory, and works in the following manner: 

1. Click on 'Start Learning'. 
2. Click on 'Add 5 translations' Enter as many translations as desired, and if more entry options are
    required, click on 'Add 5 translations' again as needed. 
3. Submit the translations. 
4. Enter the frequency at which you would like the extension to send you a notification for the next word. 
    (This must be at least 1 minute, because Chrome does not allow notifications more frequent than this.)
5. Wait for your first notification, and begin answering to the best of your ability. 
6. If you answered correctly, you will be immediately notified, and the window will close for the next word. 
7. If you answered incorrectly, you will be immediately notified, and the window will remain open to give a chance to guess again.
8. You also have the option to cancel the current session, and reset to enter new words, at any given point. 

* If the popup is open while a notification is given, it must be closed and re-opened to load the new word.
